         To their lord's murther. Roasted in wrath and fire,
         When he lay couched in the ominous horse,
         With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
         With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus

      Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top
      So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,
      Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash
      Striking too short at Greeks. His antique sword,
      Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear. For lo! his sword,

      When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
      Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,
      Which was declining on the milky head

    All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past
    Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
    An understanding simple and unschool'd;
    And I am sick at heart.
    And I believe it is a fetch of warrant.
    And I beseech you instantly to visit
    And I do think- or else this brain of mine

    And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
    And let us once again assail your ears,

    And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch

    Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,

    As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' th' working,
    As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
    As are companions noted and most known
    As fits a king's remembrance.
    As harbingers preceding still the fates
    As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
    As he in his particular act and place
    As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so.
    As if he had been loosed out of hell
    As if increase of appetite had grown
    As if it some impartment did desire
    As in their birth,- wherein they are not guilty,
    As infinite as man may undergo-  
    As it behooves my daughter and your honour.
    As it did seem to shatter all his bulk

    As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,
    At last, a little shaking of mine arm,
    At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark.        [Writes.]
    At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
    Awake the god of day; and at his warning,
    Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
    Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come.
    Be something scanter of your maiden presence.
    Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
    Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar:
    Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
    Be wary then; best safety lies in fear.
    Be you and I behind an arras then.
    Bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee.
    Been thus encount'red. A figure like your father,

    Before my daughter told me), what might you,
    Being a thing immortal as itself?  
    Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,
    Believe so much in him, that he is young,
    Both to my God and to my gracious king;
    Break we our watch up; and by my advice  
    Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
    Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
    Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
    But I have that within which passeth show-
    But answer made it none. Yet once methought
    But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee?
    But better look'd into, he truly found
    But break my heart, for I must hold my tongue!
    But come!
    But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
    But do not go with it!
    But even then the morning cock crew loud,
    But farewell it, for I will use no art.  
    But he's an arrant knave.
    But if't be he I mean, he's very wild
    But keep a farm and carters.
    But let me hear from you.
    But let that go.
    But look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
    But mere implorators of unholy suits,  
    But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
    But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son-
    But soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again!
    But soft! methinks I scent the morning air.
    But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
    But this eternal blazon must not be
    But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.
    But to my mind, though I am native here  
    But to recover of us, by strong hand
    But truly I do fear it.
    But two months dead! Nay, not so much, not two.
    But virtue, as it never will be mov'd,
    But what is your affair in Elsinore?
    But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
    But you must know, your father lost a father;
    But you shall hear. Thus:
    But you'll be secret?
    But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
    But, in the gross and scope of my opinion,
    But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips
    By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!-
    By heaven, it is as proper to our age
    By indirections find directions out.
    By laboursome petition, and at last
    By the mass, I was about to say something! Where did I leave?
    By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
    By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
    By this encompassment and drift of question
    By what it fed on; and yet, within a month-
    Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
    Carve for himself, for on his choice depends
    Colleagued with this dream of his advantage,
    Come hither, gentlemen,
    Come on! You hear this fellow in the cellarage.
    Come.
    Comes armed through our watch, so like the King

    Contagious blastments are most imminent.
    Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,  
    Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
    Dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet
    Denmark?- What, my young lady and mistress? By'r Lady, your
    Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
    Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
    Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact,
    Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak!
    Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;  
    Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
    Do I impart toward you. For your intent  
    Do not as some ungracious pastors do,
    Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
    Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
    Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
    Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,

    Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day?
    Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
    Drabbing. You may go so far.
    Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
    Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
    Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
    Extorted treasure in the womb of earth
    Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
    Farewell. My blessing season this in thee!
    Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
    Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,
    Fie on't! ah, fie! 'Tis an unweeded garden
    For bearers of this greeting to old Norway,  
    For every man hath business and desire,
    For food and diet, to some enterprise
    For he himself is subject to his birth.
    For it is as the air, invulnerable,
    For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
    For nature crescent does not grow alone
    For out o' doors he went without their help
    For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
    For the supply and profit of our hope,
    For they are actions that a man might play;
    For this effect defective comes by cause.
    For what we know must be, and is as common
    For your desire to know what is between us,
    Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
    Forward, not permanent- sweet, not lasting;
    From me, whose love was of that dignity
    From our achievements, though perform'd at height,
    From that particular fault. The dram of e'il
    From the first corse till he that died to-day,
    From whence though willingly I came to Denmark
    Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice;
    Give it an understanding but no tongue.
    Give me one poor request.
    Give you good night.                                   Exit.
    Given private time to you, and you yourself

    Giving more light than heat, extinct in both
    Giving to you no further personal power

    Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together.
    God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;

    Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,  
    Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same comart
    Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
    Had made his course t' illume that part of heaven
    Hath given me this. Now gather, and surmise.
    Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there,
    Hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws

    Have heaven and earth together demonstrated

    He closes with you in this consequence:
    He falls to such perusal of my face
    He hath not fail'd to pester us with message
    He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
    He may not, as unvalued persons do,
    He rais'd a sigh so piteous and profound
    He seem'd to find his way without his eyes,
    He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
    He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found
    He's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps. Say on; come to
    Hecuba.
    Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
    Here in the lobby.
    Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
    Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads
    His access to me.
    His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
    His father's death and our o'erhasty marriage.
    His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
    His further gait herein, in that the levies,
    His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
    His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd
    Hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood;
    Hold you the watch to-night?
    Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
    Holds such an enmity with blood of man
    Horatio!- or I do forget myself.
    How does my good Lord Hamlet?
    How now, Ophelia? What's the matter?
    How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself
    How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable
    Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
    Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
    I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
    I cannot dream of. I entreat you both
    I chiefly lov'd. 'Twas AEneas' tale to Dido, and thereabout of it
    I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
    I did repel his letters and denied
    I do beseech you give him leave to go.
    I do not set my life at a pin's fee;
    I doubt some foul play. Would the night were come!
    I had not quoted him. I fear'd he did but trifle
    I have a daughter (have while she is mine),
    I have sworn't.
    I hold it fit that we shake hands and part;
    I hold my duty as I hold my soul,
    I made to her in marriage, and to decline
    I pray thee stay with us, go not to Wittenberg.
    I saw him yesterday, or t'other day,
    I say, away!- Go on. I'll follow thee.
    I shall not look upon his like again.
    I stay too long. But here my father comes.
    I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
    I will be brief. Your noble son is mad.
    I will requite your loves. So, fare you well.
    I would know that.
    I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth
    I'll board him presently. O, give me leave.
    I'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!
    I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
    I'll visit you.
    I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
    If I had play'd the desk or table book,
    If circumstances lead me, I will find
    If it be so- as so 'tis put on me,
    If she unmask her beauty to the moon.
    If there be any good thing to be done,
    If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
    If thou didst ever thy dear father love-
    If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
    If with too credent ear you list his songs,
    If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
    If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
    Importing the surrender of those lands
    In dreadful secrecy impart they did,
    In equal scale weighing delight and dole,
    In filial obligation for some term
    In going back to school in Wittenberg,
    In honourable fashion.
    In obstinate condolement is a course
    In the dead vast and middle of the night
    In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
    In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes,
    In this distracted globe. Remember thee?
    In which the majesty of buried Denmark
    Into the madness wherein now he raves,
    Is by a forged process of my death
    Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
    Is not this something more than fantasy?
    Is the main motive of our preparations,
    It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
    It is 'Adieu, adieu! Remember me.'  
    It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you.
    It is most retrograde to our desire;
    It is not, nor it cannot come to good.
    It lifted up it head and did address
    It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
    It was against your Highness; whereat griev'd,
    It waves me forth again. I'll follow it.
    It waves you to a more removed ground.
    Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
    Keeps wassail, and the swagg'ring upspring reels,
    King, father, royal Dane. O, answer me?
    Lends the tongue vows. These blazes, daughter,
    Let it be tenable in your silence still;
    Let me be no assistant for a state,  
    Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell
    Let me not think on't! Frailty, thy name is woman!-
    Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
    Let us impart what we have seen to-night
    Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
    Like Niobe, all tears- why she, even she
    Like quills upon the fretful porpentine.
    Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
    Look to't, I charge you. Come your ways.
    Look you, I'll go pray.
    Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbrac'd,
    Lost by his father, with all bands of law,
    Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,
    Mad let us grant him then. And now remains
    Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
    Makes us traduc'd and tax'd of other nations;
    Makes vow before his uncle never more
    Making night hideous, and we fools of nature
    Marcellus?
    Mark the encounter. If he love her not,
    Mark you,
    May do t' express his love and friending to you,
    May give his saying deed; which is no further
    May sweep to my revenge.
    Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour.
    Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,
    More grief to hide than hate to utter love.
    More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
    More than his father's death, that thus hath put him
    Moreover that we much did long to see you,
    Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust
    Most welcome home!                       Exeunt Ambassadors.
    Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him
    Must render up myself.
    My custom always of the afternoon,
    My father's brother, but no more like my father
    My father's spirit- in arms? All is not well.
    My father- methinks I see my father.
    My liege, and madam, to expostulate
    My lord, not I.
    My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.
    My tables! Meet it is I set it down
    My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
    My too much changed son.- Go, some of you,
    My uncle?
    Nay, come, let's go together.  
    Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
    Never to speak of this that you have heard:
    No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
    No hat upon his head, his stockings foul'd,
    No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day
    No more.
    No reckoning made, but sent to my account
    No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
    Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.
    Nor customary suits of solemn black,
    Nor shall you do my ear that violence
    Nor the dejected havior of the visage,
    Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,
    Not of that dye which their investments show,
    Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
    Now for ourself and for this time of meeting.
    Now wears his crown.
    O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there,
    O most pernicious woman!
    O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
    O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
    O'ermaster't as you may. And now, good friends,  
    O, speak!
    Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
    Of Hamlet's transformation. So I call it,
    Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware
    Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in,
    Of general assault.  
    Of his affection to me.
    Of his behaviour.
    Of impious stubbornness. 'Tis unmanly grief;
    Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd;
    Of man and country-
    Of mine own eyes.  
    Of these dilated articles allow.            [Gives a paper.]
    Of this his nephew's purpose, to suppress
    Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
    Of unimproved mettle hot and full,  
    Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
    On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys,
    On Fortune's cap we are not the very button.
    On such regards of safety and allowance
    Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'
    Or (not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
    Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
    Or by some habit that too much o'erleavens
    Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
    Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
    Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
    Or look'd upon this love with idle sight?
    Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
    Or my dear Majesty your queen here, think,
    Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
    Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
    Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd  
    Or then, or then, with such or such; and, as you say,
    Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
    Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
    Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
    Our hasty sending. Something have you heard
    Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
    Out of his subject; and we here dispatch
    Out of the shot and danger of desire.
    Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,
    Passing through nature to eternity.  
    Perchance 'twill walk again.
    Perpend.
    Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty, these are
    Pleasant and helpful to him!
    Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
    Put your dread pleasures more into command
    Rankly abus'd. But know, thou noble youth,
    Receiv'd his love?
    Receives rebuke from Norway, and, in fine,
    Resembles that it was. What it should be,
    Respeaking earthly thunder. Come away.
    Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,
    Rome-
    Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?
    Running it thus) you'll tender me a fool.  
    Say, Voltemand, what from our brother Norway?
    Say, why is this? wherefore? What should we do?
    See you now-
    Seek for thy noble father in the dust.
    Seem to me all the uses of this world!
    Set your entreatments at a higher rate
    Shall in the general censure take corruption
    Shall you my son. You have me, have you not
    Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
    She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
    Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven,
    Since nature cannot choose his origin,-
    Sith nor th' exterior nor the inward man
    Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,
    So by his father lost; and this, I take it,
    So excellent a king, that was to this
    So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle,
    So grace and mercy at your most need help you,
    So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
    So horridly to shake our disposition
    So levied as before, against the Polack;
    So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
    So much as from occasion you may glean,  
    So much from th' understanding of himself,
    So nightly toils the subject of the land,
    So oft it chances in particular men
    So to seduce!- won to his shameful lust
    So, by my former lecture and advice,
    So, proceed you.
    So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word:
    Soil our addition; and indeed it takes
    Some little time; so by your companies
    Some say that ever, 'gainst that season comes
    Speak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!
    Speak to me.
    Speak to me.  
    Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
    Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.
    Such as it is; and for my own poor part,
    Such was the very armour he had on
    Swear by my sword.
    Swear by my sword.
    Swear.
    Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
    Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
    Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
    Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
    Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd
    Th' extravagant and erring spirit hies
    Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state,
    Than I to Hercules. Within a month,
    Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
    Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
    Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
    Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia,
    Than that which dearest father bears his son
    Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
    Than to entreaty.
    Than your particular demands will touch it.
    That I have Positively said ''Tis so,'
    That I will speak to thee. I'll call thee Hamlet,
    That are so fortified against our story,
    That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
    That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
    That ever I was born to set it right!
    That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
    That great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling
    That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
    That hath a stomach in't; which is no other,
    That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
    That he is open to incontinency.
    That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
    That it might please you to give quiet pass
    That it went hand in hand even with the vow
    That looks so many fadoms to the sea
    That may to thee do ease, and, race to me,
    That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
    That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
    That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
    That she should lock herself from his resort,
    That so his sickness, age, and impotence
    That swift as quicksilverr it courses through
    That they do know my son, come you more nearer
    That they may seem the taints of liberty,
    That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel,
    That was and is the question of these wars.
    That we find out the cause of this effect-
    That we with wisest sorrow think on him
    That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
    That you know aught of me- this is not to do,
    That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
    That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
    That youth and observation copied there,
    That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is a vile
    That's not my meaning. But breathe his faults so quaintly
    That, being of so young clays brought up with him,
    That, for some vicious mole of nature in them,
    That, if again this apparition come,
    That, open'd, lies within our remedy.
    Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!
    The apparition comes. I knew your father.
    The bell then beating one-
    The better to beguile. This is for all:
    The bird of dawning singeth all night long;
    The canker galls the infants of the spring
    The chariest maid is prodigal enough
    The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
    The first row of the pious chanson will show you more; for look
    The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
    The form of plausive manners, that these men
    The glowworm shows the matin to be near
    The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead
    The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
    The head and source of all your son's distemper.
    The head is not more native to the heart,
    The inward service of the mind and soul
    The kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out
    The leperous distilment; whose effect
    The lists, and full proportions are all made
    The memory be green, and that it us befitted
    The natural gates and alleys of the body,
    The need we have to use you did provoke
    The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,
    The perfume and suppliance of a minute;
    The pith and marrow of our attribute.
    The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
    The safety and health of this whole state,
    The serpent that did sting thy father's life
    The source of this our watch, and the chief head
    The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine;
    The time is out of joint. O cursed spite
    The triumph of his pledge.
    The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
    The very place puts toys of desperation,
    The virtue of his will; but you must fear,
    The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.
    The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
    The youth you breathe of guilty, be assur'd
    Their virtues else- be they as pure as grace,
    Then goes he to the length of all his arm,
    Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain
    Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,
    Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,
    There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
    There falling out at tennis'; or perchance,
    There was 'a gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
    Therefore I have entreated him along,  
    Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
    Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
    Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
    These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
    These hands are not more like.
    They clip us drunkards and with swinish phrase
    This above all- to thine own self be true,
    This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
    This gentle and unforc'd accord of Hamlet
    This heavy-headed revel east and west
    This is the very ecstasy of love,
    This marvel to you.
    This must be known; which, being kept close, might move
    This must not be.' And then I prescripts gave her,
    This present object made probation.
    This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
    This unprevailing woe, and think of us
    This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me;
    Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
    Thou canst not then be false to any man.
    Thou com'st in such a questionable shape
    Thou know'st 'tis common. All that lives must die,
    Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
    Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
    Through your dominions for this enterprise,
    Thus it remains, and the remainder thus.
    Thus much the business is: we have here writ
    Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
    Thy knotted and combined locks to part,
    Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
    Till then sit still, my soul. Foul deeds will rise,
    To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,
    To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack,  
    To be commanded.
    To be contracted in one brow of woe,
    To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom
    To business with the King, more than the scope
    To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
    To cast thee up again. What may this mean  
    To do obsequious sorrow. But to persever  
    To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather
    To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
    To give th' assay of arms against your Majesty.
    To give these mourning duties to your father;
    To his confine; and of the truth herein
    To his unmast'red importunity.
    To lack discretion. Come, go we to the King.
    To lay our service freely at your feet,
    To let you know of it.
    To make it truster of your own report
    To offer it the show of violence;
    To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
    To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once.
    To put an antic disposition on),  
    To reason most absurd, whose common theme
    To show my duty in your coronation,  
    To show us so much gentry and good will
    To speak of horrors- he comes before me.
    To tell the secrets of my prison house,
    To tell us this.
    To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
    To those of mine!
    To what I shall unfold.
    To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
    To you alone.
    To youth and liberty.
    Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
    Together with remembrance of ourselves.
    Together with that fair and warlike form
    Too oft before their buttons be disclos'd,
    Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us.
    Ungart'red, and down-gyved to his ankle;
    Unhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd,
    Unmix'd with baser matter. Yes, by heaven!
    Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
    Unto our climature and countrymen.
    Unto the voice and yielding of that body
    Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
    Upon a fearful summons. I have heard
    Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor  
    Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent.
    Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
    Upon our first, he sent out to suppress
    Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
    Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
    Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
    Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
    Virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes.
    Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
    Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.
    Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests
    Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
    Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.
    Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
    We do it wrong, being so majestical,
    We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
    Welcome, my good friends.
    Well may it sort that this portentous figure
    Well ratified by law and heraldry,
    Were nothing but to waste night, day, and time.
    What I have said to you.
    What company, at what expense; and finding
    What does this mean, my lord?
    What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank
    What is between you? Give me up the truth.
    What is't but to be nothing else but mad?
    What majesty should be, what duty is,
    What might be toward, that this sweaty haste  
    What might you think? No, I went round to work
    What think you on't?
    What we two nights have seen.
    What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
    What, have you given him any hard words of late?
    What, is Horatio there ?
    When I had seen this hot love on the wing
    When I to sulph'rous and tormenting flames
    When he th' ambitious Norway combated.
    When it prov'd otherwise.?
    When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
    When yond same star that's westward from the pole
    Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
    Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
    Where we shall find him most conveniently.           Exeunt.
    Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
    Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
    Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
    Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
    Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
    Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
    Whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus
    Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
    Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly,
    Which done, she took the fruits of my advice,
    Which happily foreknowing may avoid,
    Which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror;
    Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
    Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
    Who hath reliev'd you?
    Who in her duty and obedience, mark,
    Who is't that can inform me?
    Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears
    Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
    Whose violent property fordoes itself  
    Why day is day, night is night, and time is time.
    Why seems it so particular with thee?
    Why should we in our peevish opposition
    Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
    Why this same strict and most observant watch
    Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death,
    Will sate itself in a celestial bed
    With all my imperfections on my head.
    With all my love I do commend me to you;
    With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
    With an attent ear, till I may deliver
    With an auspicious, and a dropping eye,
    With an entreaty, herein further shown,
    With arms encumb'red thus, or this head-shake,
    With juice of cursed hebona in a vial,
    With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
    With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,
    With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
    With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
    With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
    With us to watch the minutes of this night,
    With which she followed my poor father's body

  Queen. I doubt it is no other but the main,

  Rey. Well, my lord.
  Reynaldo, servant to Polonius.

  Fran. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?
    Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre
         To their lord's murther. Roasted in wrath and fire,
    And gins to pale his uneffectual fire.
          'Doubt thou the stars are fire;
    For every man hath business and desire,
    Out of the shot and danger of desire.
    As if it some impartment did desire
    It is most retrograde to our desire;
    Before You visit him, to make inquire
         And thus o'ersized with coagulate gore,
    Makes vow before his uncle never more
    No more.
  Ham. You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will more
         'One fair daughter, and no more,
  Laer. Think it no more.
SCENE.- Elsinore.
    But what is your affair in Elsinore?
    make you at Elsinore?
    Within the centre.
    And pity 'tis 'tis true. A foolish figure!
    Well may it sort that this portentous figure
    Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
    Have you so slander any moment leisure
    Making night hideous, and we fools of nature
    That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
    A violet in the youth of primy nature,
    A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
    Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
    Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
    Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
      phrase.
    Or (not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
    They clip us drunkards and with swinish phrase
    Hath given me this. Now gather, and surmise.
    Till then sit still, my soul. Foul deeds will rise,
    For food and diet, to some enterprise
    Through your dominions for this enterprise,
      be otherwise.
    When it prov'd otherwise.?
  Ham. O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else?
    As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
    end his part in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose
    Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.
         When he lay couched in the ominous horse,
    In obstinate condolement is a course
    For this effect defective comes by cause.
      Doth rend the region; so, after Pyrrhus' pause,
    To tell the secrets of my prison house,
  Ham. The King doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
    There was 'a gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
    If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
    'Tis told me he hath very oft of late
    What, have you given him any hard words of late?
  Ros. I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late
    My liege, and madam, to expostulate
    Set your entreatments at a higher rate
    As it doth well appear unto our state,
    This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
    Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state,
    The safety and health of this whole state,
    Let me be no assistant for a state,  
    The time is out of joint. O cursed spite
    As of a father; for let the world take note
    Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
    The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
    What might be toward, that this sweaty haste  
    The pith and marrow of our attribute.
    The perfume and suppliance of a minute;
    Give it an understanding but no tongue.
    But break my heart, for I must hold my tongue!
    Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
  Hor. As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;  
    This above all- to thine own self be true,
    Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
    By the mass, I was about to say something! Where did I leave?
  Pol. He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
    I'll board him presently. O, give me leave.
  Rey. My lord, I have.
    But he's an arrant knave.
  Hor. There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
  Ham. Into my grave?
  Hor. Before my God, I might not this believe
    reckon my groans; but that I love thee best, O most best, believe
    those that would make mows at him while my father lived give
    And thy commandment all alone shall live
    Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
    Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
  Hor. I think it lacks of twelve.
  Pol. Mad for thy love?  
    Receiv'd his love?
    This is the very ecstasy of love,
    More grief to hide than hate to utter love.
    If thou didst ever thy dear father love-
            But never doubt I love.
    As meditation or the thoughts of love,
  Oph. My lord, he hath importun'd me with love
    And with no less nobility of love
    This must be known; which, being kept close, might move
            Doubt that the sun doth move;
    As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
  Guil. Faith, her privates we.
  Hor. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
    Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
    With an auspicious, and a dropping eye,
    No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
    Of impious stubbornness. 'Tis unmanly grief;
    Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
    Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
    not off.
                   A flourish of trumpets, and two pieces go off.
  Queen. Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
    little. 'Sblood, there is something in this more than natural, if
    So much from th' understanding of himself,
  Pol. Observe his inclination in yourself.  
    Given private time to you, and you yourself
  Fran. Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.
    Being a thing immortal as itself?  
    Whose violent property fordoes itself  
  Hor. As thou art to thyself.
    Horatio!- or I do forget myself.
    Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
    Must render up myself.
    How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself
    altitude of a chopine. Pray God your voice, like a piece of
  Guil. Which dreams indeed are ambition; for the very substance of
    nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of
    Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,
    That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
  Ber. Long live the King!
    To lack discretion. Come, go we to the King.
    Comes armed through our watch, so like the King
  Mar. Is it not like the King?
  Pol. Come, go with me. I will go seek the King.
  Queen. But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
    I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
    What company, at what expense; and finding
    roof fretted with golden fire- why, it appeareth no other thing
  Hor. And then it started, like a guilty thing  
      Did nothing.
  Ber. I have seen nothing.
  Hor. I saw him once. He was a goodly king.  
    At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
  Hamlet, son to the former, and nephew to the present king.
    Both to my God and to my gracious king;
    Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
    As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' th' working,
    That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
    That great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling
  Pol. Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
    Awake the god of day; and at his warning,
  Rey. Good my lord!                                    [Going.]
  Ghost. Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
    The canker galls the infants of the spring
  Fran. Not a mouse stirring.
    Now for ourself and for this time of meeting.
    Forward, not permanent- sweet, not lasting;
    And sure I am two men there are not living
    When I had seen this hot love on the wing
    The bird of dawning singeth all night long;
  Ham. Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?  
  Pol. This is too long.
    Therefore I have entreated him along,  
    Believe so much in him, that he is young,
    In going back to school in Wittenberg,
    But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
    I pray thee stay with us, go not to Wittenberg.
  Ham. My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern? Ah,
  Ham. Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come! Th'
  Ham. Am I not i' th' right, old Jephthah?
    And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
    taste of your quality. Come, a passionate speech.

    With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
    Why this same strict and most observant watch
    And I with them the third night kept the watch;
    (Marcellus and Bernardo) on their watch
    Without the sensible and true avouch
    The chariest maid is prodigal enough
    That swift as quicksilverr it courses through

    By what it fed on; and yet, within a month-
    Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?
    Giving more light than heat, extinct in both
    I cannot dream of. I entreat you both
    heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the earth,
    Extorted treasure in the womb of earth
    Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
  Ros. As the indifferent children of the earth.
    'This must be so.' We pray you throw to earth
    For he himself is subject to his birth.
    Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
    I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth

    And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
    Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth;
    What is between you? Give me up the truth.
    O, speak!

    Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
  Hor. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak!

    And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
    Nor customary suits of solemn black,
    So levied as before, against the Polack;
    To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack,  
      Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' th' air to stick.

  Mar. No, it is struck.

  Oph. I do not know, my lord, what I should think,
  Pol. I would fain prove so. But what might you think,

  Pol. God b' wi' ye, fare ye well!
    I will requite your loves. So, fare you well.
  Ham. I am glad to see you well.

           'As by lot, God wot,'
  Ghost. I find thee apt;
  Queen. More matter, with less art.
    But farewell it, for I will use no art.  
    And I am sick at heart.
    The head is not more native to the heart,
    And shall I couple hell? Hold, hold, my heart!
    Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same comart
    Such as it is; and for my own poor part,
    Thy knotted and combined locks to part,
    I hold it fit that we shake hands and part;
    We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
    To make it truster of your own report
    And with a look so piteous in purport
      When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
    As it is common for the younger sort
    That she should lock herself from his resort,
    That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
         'The rugged Pyrrhus, like th' Hyrcanian beast-'
  Ghost. Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
    My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.
    Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,
  Ham. Well said, old mole! Canst work i' th' earth so fast?
    By laboursome petition, and at last
    All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past
    A couch for luxury and damned incest.
  A Priest.
  Ros. None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.
    Give me one poor request.
    This heavy-headed revel east and west
    To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
                         Enter Ghost.
                        Enter Ghost.
                                                     Exit Ghost.
                                                     Exit Ghost.
  Ham. Alas, poor ghost!
    servants; for, to speak to you like an honest man, I am most
    She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
    dungeons, Denmark being one o' th' worst.
    Seek for thy noble father in the dust.
    So to seduce!- won to his shameful lust
    Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust
    By indirections find directions out.
    The kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out
    philosophy could find it out.
  Ham. My fate cries out
    And a most instant tetter bark'd about,  
    it. Adieu.
  Ham. O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
    You, as your business and desires shall point you,
  Hor. It would have much amaz'd you.
  Ham. Arm'd, say you?
    What I have said to you.
    So grace and mercy at your most need help you,
  Ham. Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you;
    Before my daughter told me), what might you,
  Queen. Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you,
    My too much changed son.- Go, some of you,
    It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you.
    With all my love I do commend me to you;
    So, proceed you.
    Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
    my leave of you.
    Mark you,
  Pol. What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?
    May do t' express his love and friending to you,
    But let me hear from you.
    To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
    Who hath reliev'd you?
    for love- very near this. I'll speak to him again.- What do you
    And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
    have sent for you.
  Both. We'll wait upon you.  
    Moreover that we much did long to see you,
    I'll visit you.
    This marvel to you.
  Ham. Sir, my good friend- I'll change that name with you.
  King. How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
  Pol. My lord, I have news to tell you.
  Ros. [aside to Guildenstern] What say you?
  Ham. And fix'd his eyes upon you?
    And that in way of caution- I must tell you
    Lost by his father, with all bands of law,
    know a hawk from a handsaw.
    Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!
  Ber. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
    it is but a shadow's shadow.
  Ham. A dream itself is but a shadow.
    Not of that dye which their investments show,
    But I have that within which passeth show-
      The bold winds speechless, and the orb below
  Ham. What hour now?
    See you now-
    Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,  
    of question and are most tyrannically clapp'd fort. These are now
    Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
 and then, you know,
  King. Not that I know.
  Pol. Ay, springes to catch woodcocks! I do know,
  Oph. My lord, I do not know,
    And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
    sing? Will they not say afterwards, if they should grow
    That it went hand in hand even with the vow
  Ber. Say-
    I saw him yesterday, or t'other day,
    Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day?
    And it must follow, as the night the day,
    No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day
    From the first corse till he that died to-day,
    For they are actions that a man might play;
    That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
    And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
    Look you, I'll go pray.
  Pol. And then, sir, does 'a this- 'a does- What was I about to say?
    Or then, or then, with such or such; and, as you say,
  Pol. Away, I do beseech you, both away
    And at the sound it shrunk in haste away
  Ber. See, it stalks away!
    Respeaking earthly thunder. Come away.
  Ham. Do the boys carry it away?  
  Fortinbras, Prince of Norway.  
    Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
    Say, Voltemand, what from our brother Norway?
    For bearers of this greeting to old Norway,  
  Pol. Marry, I will teach you! Think yourself a baby
    Here in the lobby.
    The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
    That he is open to incontinency.
    Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
  Ham. Well, God-a-mercy.
  Mar. We have sworn, my lord, already.
    That, open'd, lies within our remedy.
  Pol. The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy,
    And makes each petty artire in this body
    The natural gates and alleys of the body,
    All my smooth body.
    With which she followed my poor father's body
    Unto the voice and yielding of that body
    But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
  Guil. But we both obey,
    they?
  Ham. What, are they children? Who maintains 'em? How are they
  Ham. Why,
  Ham. Why,
    Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
  Ham. What, look'd he frowningly.
    Yes, faith, heartily.
  Ham. I am sorry they offend you, heartily;
  King. Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply.
    appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony. Let me comply
    Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly,
    You do not understand yourself so clearly
  Hor. Most constantly.
    That's not my meaning. But breathe his faults so quaintly
    heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we to th' court? for, by my
    willingly part withal- except my life, except my life, except my
    feather. I have of late- but wherefore I know not- lost all my
  Ham. No such matter! I will not sort you with the rest of my
  Ham. Aha boy, say'st thou so? Art thou there, truepenny?
    Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,
    Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
  Guil. Happy in that we are not over-happy.
    Well ratified by law and heraldry,
    And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
    And our vain blows malicious mockery.
    Yea, from the table of my memory
    And these few precepts in thy memory
    That are so fortified against our story,
  Pol. At 'closes in the consequence'- Ay, marry!
    That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
    Of man and country-
    there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury,
    Is not this something more than fantasy?
  Mar. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
    And meant to wrack thee; but beshrew my jealousy!
    Than to entreaty.
    tragedians of the city.
    gone, far gone! And truly in my youth I suff'red much extremity
    From me, whose love was of that dignity
    Passing through nature to eternity.  
    To his unmast'red importunity.
    That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
    As in their birth,- wherein they are not guilty,
    That they may seem the taints of liberty,
    To youth and liberty.
    To give th' assay of arms against your Majesty.
  Ham. How comes it? Do they grow rusty?
  Cor., Volt. In that, and all things, will we show our duty.
    And we did think it writ down in our duty
    As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
    Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
    Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,  
  Queen. Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz.  
  Ham. Buzz, buzz!

SCENE.- Elsinore.


ACT I. Scene I.
Elsinore. A platform before the Castle.

Enter two Sentinels-[first,] Francisco, [who paces up and down
at his post; then] Bernardo, [who approaches him].

  Ber. Who's there.?
  Fran. Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.
  Ber. Long live the King!
  Fran. Bernardo?
  Ber. He.
  Fran. You come most carefully upon your hour.
  Ber. 'Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.
  Fran. For this relief much thanks. 'Tis bitter cold,
    And I am sick at heart.
  Ber. Have you had quiet guard?
  Fran. Not a mouse stirring.
  Ber. Well, good night.
    If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
    The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.

                    Enter Horatio and Marcellus.  

  Fran. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?
  Hor. Friends to this ground.
  Mar. And liegemen to the Dane.
  Fran. Give you good night.
  Mar. O, farewell, honest soldier.
    Who hath reliev'd you?
  Fran. Bernardo hath my place.
    Give you good night.                                   Exit.
  Mar. Holla, Bernardo!
  Ber. Say-
    What, is Horatio there ?
  Hor. A piece of him.
  Ber. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.
  Mar. What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
  Ber. I have seen nothing.
  Mar. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
    And will not let belief take hold of him
    Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us.
    Therefore I have entreated him along,  
    With us to watch the minutes of this night,
    That, if again this apparition come,
    He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
  Hor. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
  Ber. Sit down awhile,
    And let us once again assail your ears,
    That are so fortified against our story,
    What we two nights have seen.
  Hor. Well, sit we down,
    And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
  Ber. Last night of all,
    When yond same star that's westward from the pole
    Had made his course t' illume that part of heaven
    Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
    The bell then beating one-

                        Enter Ghost.

  Mar. Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!
  Ber. In the same figure, like the King that's dead.  
  Mar. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
  Ber. Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.
  Hor. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.
  Ber. It would be spoke to.
  Mar. Question it, Horatio.
  Hor. What art thou that usurp'st this time of night
    Together with that fair and warlike form
    In which the majesty of buried Denmark
    Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak!
  Mar. It is offended.
  Ber. See, it stalks away!
  Hor. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak!
                                                     Exit Ghost.
  Mar. 'Tis gone and will not answer.
  Ber. How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale.
    Is not this something more than fantasy?
    What think you on't?
  Hor. Before my God, I might not this believe
    Without the sensible and true avouch
    Of mine own eyes.  
  Mar. Is it not like the King?
  Hor. As thou art to thyself.
    Such was the very armour he had on
    When he th' ambitious Norway combated.
    So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle,
    He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
    'Tis strange.
  Mar. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
    With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
  Hor. In what particular thought to work I know not;
    But, in the gross and scope of my opinion,
    This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
  Mar. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows,
    Why this same strict and most observant watch
    So nightly toils the subject of the land,
    And why such daily cast of brazen cannon
    And foreign mart for implements of war;
    Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
    Does not divide the Sunday from the week.
    What might be toward, that this sweaty haste  
    Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day?
    Who is't that can inform me?
  Hor. That can I.
    At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
    Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
    Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
    Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
    Dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet
    (For so this side of our known world esteem'd him)
    Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact,
    Well ratified by law and heraldry,
    Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
    Which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror;
    Against the which a moiety competent
    Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
    To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
    Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same comart
    And carriage of the article design'd,
    His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
    Of unimproved mettle hot and full,  
    Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there,
    Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
    For food and diet, to some enterprise
    That hath a stomach in't; which is no other,
    As it doth well appear unto our state,
    But to recover of us, by strong hand
    And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
    So by his father lost; and this, I take it,
    Is the main motive of our preparations,
    The source of this our watch, and the chief head
    Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
  Ber. I think it be no other but e'en so.
    Well may it sort that this portentous figure
    Comes armed through our watch, so like the King
    That was and is the question of these wars.
  Hor. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
    In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
    A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
    The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead
    Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;  
    As stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood,
    Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
    Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
    Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.
    And even the like precurse of fierce events,
    As harbingers preceding still the fates
    And prologue to the omen coming on,
    Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
    Unto our climature and countrymen.

                      Enter Ghost again.

    But soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again!
    I'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!
                                               Spreads his arms.
    If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
    Speak to me.
    If there be any good thing to be done,
    That may to thee do ease, and, race to me,
    Speak to me.  
    If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
    Which happily foreknowing may avoid,
    O, speak!
    Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
    Extorted treasure in the womb of earth
    (For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death),
                                                 The cock crows.
    Speak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!
  Mar. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
  Hor. Do, if it will not stand.
  Ber. 'Tis here!
  Hor. 'Tis here!
  Mar. 'Tis gone!
                                                     Exit Ghost.
    We do it wrong, being so majestical,
    To offer it the show of violence;
    For it is as the air, invulnerable,
    And our vain blows malicious mockery.
  Ber. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
  Hor. And then it started, like a guilty thing  
    Upon a fearful summons. I have heard
    The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
    Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
    Awake the god of day; and at his warning,
    Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
    Th' extravagant and erring spirit hies
    To his confine; and of the truth herein
    This present object made probation.
  Mar. It faded on the crowing of the cock.
    Some say that ever, 'gainst that season comes
    Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
    The bird of dawning singeth all night long;
    And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad,
    The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,
    No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
    So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
  Hor. So have I heard and do in part believe it.
    But look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
    Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.
    Break we our watch up; and by my advice  
    Let us impart what we have seen to-night
    Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
    This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
    Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
    As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
    Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
    Where we shall find him most conveniently.           Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. A room of state in the Castle.

Flourish. [Enter Claudius, King of Denmark, Gertrude the Queen, Hamlet,
Polonius, Laertes and his sister Ophelia, [Voltemand, Cornelius,]
Lords Attendant.

  King. Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
    The memory be green, and that it us befitted
    To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom
    To be contracted in one brow of woe,
    Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
    That we with wisest sorrow think on him
    Together with remembrance of ourselves.
    Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
    Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state,
    Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,
    With an auspicious, and a dropping eye,
    With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,
    In equal scale weighing delight and dole,
    Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd
    Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone  
    With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
    Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
    Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
    Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
    Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
    Colleagued with this dream of his advantage,
    He hath not fail'd to pester us with message
    Importing the surrender of those lands
    Lost by his father, with all bands of law,
    To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
    Now for ourself and for this time of meeting.
    Thus much the business is: we have here writ
    To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,
    Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears
    Of this his nephew's purpose, to suppress
    His further gait herein, in that the levies,
    The lists, and full proportions are all made
    Out of his subject; and we here dispatch
    You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,
    For bearers of this greeting to old Norway,  
    Giving to you no further personal power
    To business with the King, more than the scope
    Of these dilated articles allow.            [Gives a paper.]
    Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
  Cor., Volt. In that, and all things, will we show our duty.
  King. We doubt it nothing. Heartily farewell.
                                 Exeunt Voltemand and Cornelius.
    And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
    You told us of some suit. What is't, Laertes?
    You cannot speak of reason to the Dane
    And lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
    That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
    The head is not more native to the heart,
    The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
    Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
    What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
  Laer. My dread lord,
    Your leave and favour to return to France;
    From whence though willingly I came to Denmark
    To show my duty in your coronation,  
    Yet now I must confess, that duty done,
    My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
    And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
  King. Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
  Pol. He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
    By laboursome petition, and at last
    Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent.
    I do beseech you give him leave to go.
  King. Take thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine,
    And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
    But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son-
  Ham. [aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind!
  King. How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
  Ham. Not so, my lord. I am too much i' th' sun.
  Queen. Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
    And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
    Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
    Seek for thy noble father in the dust.
    Thou know'st 'tis common. All that lives must die,
    Passing through nature to eternity.  
  Ham. Ay, madam, it is common.
  Queen. If it be,
    Why seems it so particular with thee?
  Ham. Seems, madam, Nay, it is. I know not 'seems.'
    'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
    Nor customary suits of solemn black,
    Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,
    No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
    Nor the dejected havior of the visage,
    Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
    'That can denote me truly. These indeed seem,
    For they are actions that a man might play;
    But I have that within which passeth show-
    These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
  King. 'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
    To give these mourning duties to your father;
    But you must know, your father lost a father;
    That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
    In filial obligation for some term
    To do obsequious sorrow. But to persever  
    In obstinate condolement is a course
    Of impious stubbornness. 'Tis unmanly grief;
    It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
    A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
    An understanding simple and unschool'd;
    For what we know must be, and is as common
    As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
    Why should we in our peevish opposition
    Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
    A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
    To reason most absurd, whose common theme
    Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
    From the first corse till he that died to-day,
    'This must be so.' We pray you throw to earth
    This unprevailing woe, and think of us
    As of a father; for let the world take note
    You are the most immediate to our throne,
    And with no less nobility of love
    Than that which dearest father bears his son
    Do I impart toward you. For your intent  
    In going back to school in Wittenberg,
    It is most retrograde to our desire;
    And we beseech you, bend you to remain
    Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
    Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
  Queen. Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.
    I pray thee stay with us, go not to Wittenberg.
  Ham. I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
  King. Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply.
    Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come.
    This gentle and unforc'd accord of Hamlet
    Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,
    No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day
    But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
    And the King's rouse the heaven shall bruit again,
    Respeaking earthly thunder. Come away.
                                Flourish. Exeunt all but Hamlet.
  Ham. O that this too too solid flesh would melt,
    Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!
    Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd  
    His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
    How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable
    Seem to me all the uses of this world!
    Fie on't! ah, fie! 'Tis an unweeded garden
    That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
    Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
    But two months dead! Nay, not so much, not two.
    So excellent a king, that was to this
    Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
    That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
    Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
    Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him
    As if increase of appetite had grown
    By what it fed on; and yet, within a month-
    Let me not think on't! Frailty, thy name is woman!-
    A little month, or ere those shoes were old
    With which she followed my poor father's body
    Like Niobe, all tears- why she, even she
    (O God! a beast that wants discourse of reason
    Would have mourn'd longer) married with my uncle;  
    My father's brother, but no more like my father
    Than I to Hercules. Within a month,
    Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
    Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
    She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
    With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
    It is not, nor it cannot come to good.
    But break my heart, for I must hold my tongue!

          Enter Horatio, Marcellus, and Bernardo.

  Hor. Hail to your lordship!
  Ham. I am glad to see you well.
    Horatio!- or I do forget myself.
  Hor. The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
  Ham. Sir, my good friend- I'll change that name with you.
    And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?
    Marcellus?
  Mar. My good lord!
  Ham. I am very glad to see you.- [To Bernardo] Good even, sir.-  
    But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
  Hor. A truant disposition, good my lord.
  Ham. I would not hear your enemy say so,
    Nor shall you do my ear that violence
    To make it truster of your own report
    Against yourself. I know you are no truant.
    But what is your affair in Elsinore?
    We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
  Hor. My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
  Ham. I prithee do not mock me, fellow student.
    I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
  Hor. Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.
  Ham. Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak'd meats
    Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
    Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
    Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
    My father- methinks I see my father.
  Hor. O, where, my lord?
  Ham. In my mind's eye, Horatio.
  Hor. I saw him once. He was a goodly king.  
  Ham. He was a man, take him for all in all.
    I shall not look upon his like again.
  Hor. My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
  Ham. Saw? who?
  Hor. My lord, the King your father.
  Ham. The King my father?
  Hor. Season your admiration for a while
    With an attent ear, till I may deliver
    Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
    This marvel to you.
  Ham. For God's love let me hear!
  Hor. Two nights together had these gentlemen
    (Marcellus and Bernardo) on their watch
    In the dead vast and middle of the night
    Been thus encount'red. A figure like your father,
    Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
    Appears before them and with solemn march
    Goes slow and stately by them. Thrice he walk'd
    By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
    Within his truncheon's length; whilst they distill'd  
    Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
    Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
    In dreadful secrecy impart they did,
    And I with them the third night kept the watch;
    Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
    Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
    The apparition comes. I knew your father.
    These hands are not more like.
  Ham. But where was this?
  Mar. My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
  Ham. Did you not speak to it?
  Hor. My lord, I did;
    But answer made it none. Yet once methought
    It lifted up it head and did address
    Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
    But even then the morning cock crew loud,
    And at the sound it shrunk in haste away
    And vanish'd from our sight.
  Ham. 'Tis very strange.
  Hor. As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;  
    And we did think it writ down in our duty
    To let you know of it.
  Ham. Indeed, indeed, sirs. But this troubles me.
    Hold you the watch to-night?
  Both [Mar. and Ber.] We do, my lord.
  Ham. Arm'd, say you?
  Both. Arm'd, my lord.
  Ham. From top to toe?
  Both. My lord, from head to foot.
  Ham. Then saw you not his face?
  Hor. O, yes, my lord! He wore his beaver up.
  Ham. What, look'd he frowningly.
  Hor. A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
  Ham. Pale or red?
  Hor. Nay, very pale.
  Ham. And fix'd his eyes upon you?
  Hor. Most constantly.
  Ham. I would I had been there.
  Hor. It would have much amaz'd you.
  Ham. Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?  
  Hor. While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
  Both. Longer, longer.
  Hor. Not when I saw't.
  Ham. His beard was grizzled- no?
  Hor. It was, as I have seen it in his life,
    A sable silver'd.
  Ham. I will watch to-night.
    Perchance 'twill walk again.
  Hor. I warr'nt it will.
  Ham. If it assume my noble father's person,
    I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
    And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
    If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
    Let it be tenable in your silence still;
    And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
    Give it an understanding but no tongue.
    I will requite your loves. So, fare you well.
    Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
    I'll visit you.
  All. Our duty to your honour.  
  Ham. Your loves, as mine to you. Farewell.
                                        Exeunt [all but Hamlet].
    My father's spirit- in arms? All is not well.
    I doubt some foul play. Would the night were come!
    Till then sit still, my soul. Foul deeds will rise,
    Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
Exit.




Scene III.
Elsinore. A room in the house of Polonius.

Enter Laertes and Ophelia.

  Laer. My necessaries are embark'd. Farewell.
    And, sister, as the winds give benefit
    And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
    But let me hear from you.
  Oph. Do you doubt that?
  Laer. For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,
    Hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood;
    A violet in the youth of primy nature,
    Forward, not permanent- sweet, not lasting;
    The perfume and suppliance of a minute;
    No more.
  Oph. No more but so?
  Laer. Think it no more.
    For nature crescent does not grow alone
    In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes,
    The inward service of the mind and soul
    Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,  
    And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
    The virtue of his will; but you must fear,
    His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
    For he himself is subject to his birth.
    He may not, as unvalued persons do,
    Carve for himself, for on his choice depends
    The safety and health of this whole state,
    And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd
    Unto the voice and yielding of that body
    Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
    It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
    As he in his particular act and place
    May give his saying deed; which is no further
    Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
    Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain
    If with too credent ear you list his songs,
    Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
    To his unmast'red importunity.
    Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
    And keep you in the rear of your affection,  
    Out of the shot and danger of desire.
    The chariest maid is prodigal enough
    If she unmask her beauty to the moon.
    Virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes.
    The canker galls the infants of the spring
    Too oft before their buttons be disclos'd,
    And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
    Contagious blastments are most imminent.
    Be wary then; best safety lies in fear.
    Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
  Oph. I shall th' effect of this good lesson keep
    As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
    Do not as some ungracious pastors do,
    Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven,
    Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
    Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads
    And recks not his own rede.
  Laer. O, fear me not!

                       Enter Polonius.  

    I stay too long. But here my father comes.
    A double blessing is a double grace;
    Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
  Pol. Yet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame!
    The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
    And you are stay'd for. There- my blessing with thee!
    And these few precepts in thy memory
    Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
    Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.
    Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar:
    Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
    Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel;
    But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
    Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware
    Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in,
    Bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee.
    Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice;
    Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
    Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,  
    But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
    For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
    And they in France of the best rank and station
    Are most select and generous, chief in that.
    Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
    For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
    And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
    This above all- to thine own self be true,
    And it must follow, as the night the day,
    Thou canst not then be false to any man.
    Farewell. My blessing season this in thee!
  Laer. Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
  Pol. The time invites you. Go, your servants tend.
  Laer. Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well
    What I have said to you.
  Oph. 'Tis in my memory lock'd,
    And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
  Laer. Farewell.                                          Exit.
  Pol. What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?
  Oph. So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.  
  Pol. Marry, well bethought!
    'Tis told me he hath very oft of late
    Given private time to you, and you yourself
    Have of your audience been most free and bounteous.
    If it be so- as so 'tis put on me,
    And that in way of caution- I must tell you
    You do not understand yourself so clearly
    As it behooves my daughter and your honour.
    What is between you? Give me up the truth.
  Oph. He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
    Of his affection to me.
  Pol. Affection? Pooh! You speak like a green girl,
    Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
    Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
  Oph. I do not know, my lord, what I should think,
  Pol. Marry, I will teach you! Think yourself a baby
    That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
    Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly,
    Or (not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
    Running it thus) you'll tender me a fool.  
  Oph. My lord, he hath importun'd me with love
    In honourable fashion.
  Pol. Ay, fashion you may call it. Go to, go to!
  Oph. And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
    With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
  Pol. Ay, springes to catch woodcocks! I do know,
    When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
    Lends the tongue vows. These blazes, daughter,
    Giving more light than heat, extinct in both
    Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
    You must not take for fire. From this time
    Be something scanter of your maiden presence.
    Set your entreatments at a higher rate
    Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
    Believe so much in him, that he is young,
    And with a larger tether may he walk
    Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia,
    Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
    Not of that dye which their investments show,
    But mere implorators of unholy suits,  
    Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
    The better to beguile. This is for all:
    I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth
    Have you so slander any moment leisure
    As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
    Look to't, I charge you. Come your ways.
  Oph. I shall obey, my lord.
                                                         Exeunt.




Scene IV.
Elsinore. The platform before the Castle.

Enter Hamlet, Horatio, and Marcellus.

  Ham. The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
  Hor. It is a nipping and an eager air.
  Ham. What hour now?
  Hor. I think it lacks of twelve.
  Mar. No, it is struck.
  Hor. Indeed? I heard it not. It then draws near the season
    Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
                   A flourish of trumpets, and two pieces go off.
    What does this mean, my lord?
  Ham. The King doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
    Keeps wassail, and the swagg'ring upspring reels,
    And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
    The kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out
    The triumph of his pledge.
  Hor. Is it a custom?
  Ham. Ay, marry, is't;
    But to my mind, though I am native here  
    And to the manner born, it is a custom
    More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
    This heavy-headed revel east and west
    Makes us traduc'd and tax'd of other nations;
    They clip us drunkards and with swinish phrase
    Soil our addition; and indeed it takes
    From our achievements, though perform'd at height,
    The pith and marrow of our attribute.
    So oft it chances in particular men
    That, for some vicious mole of nature in them,
    As in their birth,- wherein they are not guilty,
    Since nature cannot choose his origin,-
    By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
    Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
    Or by some habit that too much o'erleavens
    The form of plausive manners, that these men
    Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
    Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,
    Their virtues else- be they as pure as grace,
    As infinite as man may undergo-  
    Shall in the general censure take corruption
    From that particular fault. The dram of e'il
    Doth all the noble substance often dout To his own scandal.

                         Enter Ghost.

  Hor. Look, my lord, it comes!
  Ham. Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
    Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
    Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
    Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
    Thou com'st in such a questionable shape
    That I will speak to thee. I'll call thee Hamlet,
    King, father, royal Dane. O, answer me?
    Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell
    Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death,
    Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre
    Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
    Hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws
    To cast thee up again. What may this mean  
    That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel,
    Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,
    Making night hideous, and we fools of nature
    So horridly to shake our disposition
    With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
    Say, why is this? wherefore? What should we do?
                                           Ghost beckons Hamlet.
  Hor. It beckons you to go away with it,
    As if it some impartment did desire
    To you alone.
  Mar. Look with what courteous action
    It waves you to a more removed ground.
    But do not go with it!
  Hor. No, by no means!
  Ham. It will not speak. Then will I follow it.
  Hor. Do not, my lord!
  Ham. Why, what should be the fear?
    I do not set my life at a pin's fee;
    And for my soul, what can it do to that,
    Being a thing immortal as itself?  
    It waves me forth again. I'll follow it.
  Hor. What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
    Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
    That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
    And there assume some other, horrible form
    Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
    And draw you into madness? Think of it.
    The very place puts toys of desperation,
    Without more motive, into every brain
    That looks so many fadoms to the sea
    And hears it roar beneath.
  Ham. It waves me still.
    Go on. I'll follow thee.
  Mar. You shall not go, my lord.
  Ham. Hold off your hands!
  Hor. Be rul'd. You shall not go.
  Ham. My fate cries out
    And makes each petty artire in this body
    As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
                                                [Ghost beckons.]  
    Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.
    By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!-
    I say, away!- Go on. I'll follow thee.
                                        Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet.
  Hor. He waxes desperate with imagination.
  Mar. Let's follow. 'Tis not fit thus to obey him.
  Hor. Have after. To what issue wail this come?
  Mar. Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
  Hor. Heaven will direct it.
  Mar. Nay, let's follow him.
                                                         Exeunt.




Scene V.
Elsinore. The Castle. Another part of the fortifications.

Enter Ghost and Hamlet.

  Ham. Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak! I'll go no further.
  Ghost. Mark me.
  Ham. I will.
  Ghost. My hour is almost come,
    When I to sulph'rous and tormenting flames
    Must render up myself.
  Ham. Alas, poor ghost!
  Ghost. Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
    To what I shall unfold.
  Ham. Speak. I am bound to hear.
  Ghost. So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
  Ham. What?
  Ghost. I am thy father's spirit,
    Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
    And for the day confin'd to fast in fires,
    Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
    Are burnt and purg'd away. But that I am forbid  
    To tell the secrets of my prison house,
    I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
    Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
    Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
    Thy knotted and combined locks to part,
    And each particular hair to stand an end
    Like quills upon the fretful porpentine.
    But this eternal blazon must not be
    To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
    If thou didst ever thy dear father love-
  Ham. O God!
  Ghost. Revenge his foul and most unnatural murther.
  Ham. Murther?
  Ghost. Murther most foul, as in the best it is;
    But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.
  Ham. Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
    As meditation or the thoughts of love,
    May sweep to my revenge.
  Ghost. I find thee apt;
    And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed  
    That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
    Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.
    'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
    A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark
    Is by a forged process of my death
    Rankly abus'd. But know, thou noble youth,
    The serpent that did sting thy father's life
    Now wears his crown.
  Ham. O my prophetic soul!
    My uncle?
  Ghost. Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
    With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts-
    O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
    So to seduce!- won to his shameful lust
    The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.
    O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there,
    From me, whose love was of that dignity
    That it went hand in hand even with the vow
    I made to her in marriage, and to decline
    Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor  
    To those of mine!
    But virtue, as it never will be mov'd,
    Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
    So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
    Will sate itself in a celestial bed
    And prey on garbage.
    But soft! methinks I scent the morning air.
    Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
    My custom always of the afternoon,
    Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
    With juice of cursed hebona in a vial,
    And in the porches of my ears did pour
    The leperous distilment; whose effect
    Holds such an enmity with blood of man
    That swift as quicksilverr it courses through
    The natural gates and alleys of the body,
    And with a sudden vigour it doth posset
    And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
    The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine;
    And a most instant tetter bark'd about,  
    Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust
    All my smooth body.
    Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
    Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd;
    Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
    Unhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd,
    No reckoning made, but sent to my account
    With all my imperfections on my head.
  Ham. O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
  Ghost. If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.
    Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
    A couch for luxury and damned incest.
    But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
    Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
    Against thy mother aught. Leave her to heaven,
    And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge
    To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once.
    The glowworm shows the matin to be near
    And gins to pale his uneffectual fire.
    Adieu, adieu, adieu! Remember me.                      Exit.  
  Ham. O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else?
    And shall I couple hell? Hold, hold, my heart!
    And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
    But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee?
    Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
    In this distracted globe. Remember thee?
    Yea, from the table of my memory
    I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
    All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past
    That youth and observation copied there,
    And thy commandment all alone shall live
    Within the book and volume of my brain,
    Unmix'd with baser matter. Yes, by heaven!
    O most pernicious woman!
    O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
    My tables! Meet it is I set it down
    That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
    At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark.        [Writes.]
    So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word:
    It is 'Adieu, adieu! Remember me.'  
    I have sworn't.
  Hor. (within) My lord, my lord!

                   Enter Horatio and Marcellus.

  Mar. Lord Hamlet!
  Hor. Heaven secure him!
  Ham. So be it!
  Mar. Illo, ho, ho, my lord!
  Ham. Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come.
  Mar. How is't, my noble lord?
  Hor. What news, my lord?
  Mar. O, wonderful!
  Hor. Good my lord, tell it.
  Ham. No, you will reveal it.
  Hor. Not I, my lord, by heaven!
  Mar. Nor I, my lord.
  Ham. How say you then? Would heart of man once think it?
    But you'll be secret?
  Both. Ay, by heaven, my lord.  
  Ham. There's neer a villain dwelling in all Denmark
    But he's an arrant knave.
  Hor. There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
    To tell us this.
  Ham. Why, right! You are in the right!
    And so, without more circumstance at all,
    I hold it fit that we shake hands and part;
    You, as your business and desires shall point you,
    For every man hath business and desire,
    Such as it is; and for my own poor part,
    Look you, I'll go pray.
  Hor. These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
  Ham. I am sorry they offend you, heartily;
    Yes, faith, heartily.
  Hor. There's no offence, my lord.
  Ham. Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
    And much offence too. Touching this vision here,
    It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you.
    For your desire to know what is between us,
    O'ermaster't as you may. And now, good friends,  
    As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,
    Give me one poor request.
  Hor. What is't, my lord? We will.
  Ham. Never make known what you have seen to-night.
  Both. My lord, we will not.
  Ham. Nay, but swear't.
  Hor. In faith,
    My lord, not I.
  Mar. Nor I, my lord- in faith.
  Ham. Upon my sword.
  Mar. We have sworn, my lord, already.
  Ham. Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.

                 Ghost cries under the stage.

  Ghost. Swear.
  Ham. Aha boy, say'st thou so? Art thou there, truepenny?
    Come on! You hear this fellow in the cellarage.
    Consent to swear.
  Hor. Propose the oath, my lord.  
  Ham. Never to speak of this that you have seen.
    Swear by my sword.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear.
  Ham. Hic et ubique? Then we'll shift our ground.
    Come hither, gentlemen,
    And lay your hands again upon my sword.
    Never to speak of this that you have heard:
    Swear by my sword.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear by his sword.
  Ham. Well said, old mole! Canst work i' th' earth so fast?
    A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends."
  Hor. O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
  Ham. And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
    There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
    Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
    But come!
    Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
    How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself
    (As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
    To put an antic disposition on),  
    That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
    With arms encumb'red thus, or this head-shake,
    Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
    As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'
    Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'
    Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
    That you know aught of me- this is not to do,
    So grace and mercy at your most need help you,
    Swear.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear.
                                                   [They swear.]
  Ham. Rest, rest, perturbed spirit! So, gentlemen,
    With all my love I do commend me to you;
    And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
    May do t' express his love and friending to you,
    God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;
    And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
    The time is out of joint. O cursed spite
    That ever I was born to set it right!
    Nay, come, let's go together.  
                                                         Exeunt.




Act II. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the house of Polonius.

Enter Polonius and Reynaldo.

  Pol. Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.
  Rey. I will, my lord.
  Pol. You shall do marvell's wisely, good Reynaldo,
    Before You visit him, to make inquire
    Of his behaviour.
  Rey. My lord, I did intend it.
  Pol. Marry, well said, very well said. Look you, sir,
    Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
    And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
    What company, at what expense; and finding
    By this encompassment and drift of question
    That they do know my son, come you more nearer
    Than your particular demands will touch it.
    Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
    As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,
    And in part him.' Do you mark this, Reynaldo?
  Rey. Ay, very well, my lord.  
  Pol. 'And in part him, but,' you may say, 'not well.
    But if't be he I mean, he's very wild
    Addicted so and so'; and there put on him
    What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank
    As may dishonour him- take heed of that;
    But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips
    As are companions noted and most known
    To youth and liberty.
  Rey. As gaming, my lord.
  Pol. Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
    Drabbing. You may go so far.
  Rey. My lord, that would dishonour him.
  Pol. Faith, no, as you may season it in the charge.
    You must not put another scandal on him,
    That he is open to incontinency.
    That's not my meaning. But breathe his faults so quaintly
    That they may seem the taints of liberty,
    The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
    A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
    Of general assault.  
  Rey. But, my good lord-
  Pol. Wherefore should you do this?
  Rey. Ay, my lord,
    I would know that.
  Pol. Marry, sir, here's my drift,
    And I believe it is a fetch of warrant.
    You laying these slight sullies on my son
    As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' th' working,
    Mark you,
    Your party in converse, him you would sound,
    Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
    The youth you breathe of guilty, be assur'd
    He closes with you in this consequence:
    'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman'-
    According to the phrase or the addition
    Of man and country-
  Rey. Very good, my lord.
  Pol. And then, sir, does 'a this- 'a does- What was I about to say?
    By the mass, I was about to say something! Where did I leave?
  Rey. At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,' and  
    gentleman.'
  Pol. At 'closes in the consequence'- Ay, marry!
    He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman.
    I saw him yesterday, or t'other day,
    Or then, or then, with such or such; and, as you say,
    There was 'a gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
    There falling out at tennis'; or perchance,
    'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'
    Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
    See you now-
    Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth;
    And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
    With windlasses and with assays of bias,
    By indirections find directions out.
    So, by my former lecture and advice,
    Shall you my son. You have me, have you not
  Rey. My lord, I have.
  Pol. God b' wi' ye, fare ye well!
  Rey. Good my lord!                                    [Going.]
  Pol. Observe his inclination in yourself.  
  Rey. I shall, my lord.
  Pol. And let him ply his music.
  Rey. Well, my lord.
  Pol. Farewell!
                                                  Exit Reynaldo.

                       Enter Ophelia.

    How now, Ophelia? What's the matter?
  Oph. O my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!
  Pol. With what, i' th' name of God I
  Oph. My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
    Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbrac'd,
    No hat upon his head, his stockings foul'd,
    Ungart'red, and down-gyved to his ankle;
    Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,
    And with a look so piteous in purport
    As if he had been loosed out of hell
    To speak of horrors- he comes before me.
  Pol. Mad for thy love?  
  Oph. My lord, I do not know,
    But truly I do fear it.
  Pol. What said he?
  Oph. He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
    Then goes he to the length of all his arm,
    And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
    He falls to such perusal of my face
    As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so.
    At last, a little shaking of mine arm,
    And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
    He rais'd a sigh so piteous and profound
    As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
    And end his being. That done, he lets me go,
    And with his head over his shoulder turn'd
    He seem'd to find his way without his eyes,
    For out o' doors he went without their help
    And to the last bended their light on me.
  Pol. Come, go with me. I will go seek the King.
    This is the very ecstasy of love,
    Whose violent property fordoes itself  
    And leads the will to desperate undertakings
    As oft as any passion under heaven
    That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
    What, have you given him any hard words of late?
  Oph. No, my good lord; but, as you did command,
    I did repel his letters and denied
    His access to me.
  Pol. That hath made him mad.
    I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
    I had not quoted him. I fear'd he did but trifle
    And meant to wrack thee; but beshrew my jealousy!
    By heaven, it is as proper to our age
    To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
    As it is common for the younger sort
    To lack discretion. Come, go we to the King.
    This must be known; which, being kept close, might move
    More grief to hide than hate to utter love.
    Come.
                                                         Exeunt.

Scene II.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Flourish. [Enter King and Queen, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, cum aliis.

  King. Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
    Moreover that we much did long to see you,
    The need we have to use you did provoke
    Our hasty sending. Something have you heard
    Of Hamlet's transformation. So I call it,
    Sith nor th' exterior nor the inward man
    Resembles that it was. What it should be,
    More than his father's death, that thus hath put him
    So much from th' understanding of himself,
    I cannot dream of. I entreat you both
    That, being of so young clays brought up with him,
    And since so neighbour'd to his youth and haviour,
    That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
    Some little time; so by your companies
    To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather
    So much as from occasion you may glean,  
    Whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus
    That, open'd, lies within our remedy.
  Queen. Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you,
    And sure I am two men there are not living
    To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
    To show us so much gentry and good will
    As to expend your time with us awhile
    For the supply and profit of our hope,
    Your visitation shall receive such thanks
    As fits a king's remembrance.
  Ros. Both your Majesties
    Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,
    Put your dread pleasures more into command
    Than to entreaty.
  Guil. But we both obey,
    And here give up ourselves, in the full bent,
    To lay our service freely at your feet,
    To be commanded.
  King. Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
  Queen. Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz.  
    And I beseech you instantly to visit
    My too much changed son.- Go, some of you,
    And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
  Guil. Heavens make our presence and our practices
    Pleasant and helpful to him!
  Queen. Ay, amen!
                 Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, [with some
                                                    Attendants].

                         Enter Polonius.

  Pol. Th' ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,
    Are joyfully return'd.
  King. Thou still hast been the father of good news.
  Pol. Have I, my lord? Assure you, my good liege,
    I hold my duty as I hold my soul,
    Both to my God and to my gracious king;
    And I do think- or else this brain of mine
    Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
    As it hath us'd to do- that I have found  
    The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
  King. O, speak of that! That do I long to hear.
  Pol. Give first admittance to th' ambassadors.
    My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.
  King. Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.
                                                [Exit Polonius.]
    He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found
    The head and source of all your son's distemper.
  Queen. I doubt it is no other but the main,
    His father's death and our o'erhasty marriage.
  King. Well, we shall sift him.

              Enter Polonius, Voltemand, and Cornelius.

    Welcome, my good friends.
    Say, Voltemand, what from our brother Norway?
  Volt. Most fair return of greetings and desires.
    Upon our first, he sent out to suppress
    His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd
    To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack,  
    But better look'd into, he truly found
    It was against your Highness; whereat griev'd,
    That so his sickness, age, and impotence
    Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests
    On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys,
    Receives rebuke from Norway, and, in fine,
    Makes vow before his uncle never more
    To give th' assay of arms against your Majesty.
    Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
    Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee
    And his commission to employ those soldiers,
    So levied as before, against the Polack;
    With an entreaty, herein further shown,
                                                [Gives a paper.]
    That it might please you to give quiet pass
    Through your dominions for this enterprise,
    On such regards of safety and allowance
    As therein are set down.
  King. It likes us well;
    And at our more consider'd time we'll read,  
    Answer, and think upon this business.
    Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour.
    Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together.
    Most welcome home!                       Exeunt Ambassadors.
  Pol. This business is well ended.
    My liege, and madam, to expostulate
    What majesty should be, what duty is,
    Why day is day, night is night, and time is time.
    Were nothing but to waste night, day, and time.
    Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
    And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
    I will be brief. Your noble son is mad.
    Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,
    What is't but to be nothing else but mad?
    But let that go.
  Queen. More matter, with less art.
  Pol. Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
    That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
    And pity 'tis 'tis true. A foolish figure!
    But farewell it, for I will use no art.  
    Mad let us grant him then. And now remains
    That we find out the cause of this effect-
    Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
    For this effect defective comes by cause.
    Thus it remains, and the remainder thus.
    Perpend.
    I have a daughter (have while she is mine),
    Who in her duty and obedience, mark,
    Hath given me this. Now gather, and surmise.
                                             [Reads] the letter.
    'To the celestial, and my soul's idol, the most beautified
      Ophelia,'-

    That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is a vile
      phrase.
    But you shall hear. Thus:
                                                        [Reads.]
    'In her excellent white bosom, these, &c.'
  Queen. Came this from Hamlet to her?
  Pol. Good madam, stay awhile. I will be faithful.     [Reads.]  

          'Doubt thou the stars are fire;
            Doubt that the sun doth move;
          Doubt truth to be a liar;
            But never doubt I love.
      'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers; I have not art to
    reckon my groans; but that I love thee best, O most best, believe
    it. Adieu.
      'Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to him,
                                                          HAMLET.'

    This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me;
    And more above, hath his solicitings,
    As they fell out by time, by means, and place,
    All given to mine ear.
  King. But how hath she
    Receiv'd his love?
  Pol. What do you think of me?
  King. As of a man faithful and honourable.
  Pol. I would fain prove so. But what might you think,  
    When I had seen this hot love on the wing
    (As I perceiv'd it, I must tell you that,
    Before my daughter told me), what might you,
    Or my dear Majesty your queen here, think,
    If I had play'd the desk or table book,
    Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
    Or look'd upon this love with idle sight?
    What might you think? No, I went round to work
    And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
    'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star.
    This must not be.' And then I prescripts gave her,
    That she should lock herself from his resort,
    Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
    Which done, she took the fruits of my advice,
    And he, repulsed, a short tale to make,
    Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,
    Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,
    Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,
    Into the madness wherein now he raves,
    And all we mourn for.  
  King. Do you think 'tis this?
  Queen. it may be, very like.
  Pol. Hath there been such a time- I would fain know that-
    That I have Positively said ''Tis so,'
    When it prov'd otherwise.?
  King. Not that I know.
  Pol. [points to his head and shoulder] Take this from this, if this
      be otherwise.
    If circumstances lead me, I will find
    Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
    Within the centre.
  King. How may we try it further?
  Pol. You know sometimes he walks four hours together
    Here in the lobby.
  Queen. So he does indeed.
  Pol. At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him.
    Be you and I behind an arras then.
    Mark the encounter. If he love her not,
    And he not from his reason fall'n thereon
    Let me be no assistant for a state,  
    But keep a farm and carters.
  King. We will try it.

                 Enter Hamlet, reading on a book.

  Queen. But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
  Pol. Away, I do beseech you, both away
    I'll board him presently. O, give me leave.
                       Exeunt King and Queen, [with Attendants].
    How does my good Lord Hamlet?
  Ham. Well, God-a-mercy.
  Pol. Do you know me, my lord?
  Ham. Excellent well. You are a fishmonger.
  Pol. Not I, my lord.
  Ham. Then I would you were so honest a man.
  Pol. Honest, my lord?
  Ham. Ay, sir. To be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man
    pick'd out of ten thousand.
  Pol. That's very true, my lord.
  Ham. For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god  
    kissing carrion- Have you a daughter?
  Pol. I have, my lord.
  Ham. Let her not walk i' th' sun. Conception is a blessing, but not
    as your daughter may conceive. Friend, look to't.
  Pol. [aside] How say you by that? Still harping on my daughter. Yet
    he knew me not at first. He said I was a fishmonger. He is far
    gone, far gone! And truly in my youth I suff'red much extremity
    for love- very near this. I'll speak to him again.- What do you
    read, my lord?
  Ham. Words, words, words.
  Pol. What is the matter, my lord?
  Ham. Between who?
  Pol. I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
  Ham. Slanders, sir; for the satirical rogue says here that old men
    have grey beards; that their faces are wrinkled; their eyes
    purging thick amber and plum-tree gum; and that they have a
    plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams. All which,
    sir, though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I hold it
    not honesty to have it thus set down; for you yourself, sir,
    should be old as I am if, like a crab, you could go backward.  
  Pol. [aside] Though this be madness, yet there is a method in't.-
   Will You walk out of the air, my lord?
  Ham. Into my grave?
  Pol. Indeed, that is out o' th' air. [Aside] How pregnant sometimes
    his replies are! a happiness that often madness hits on, which
    reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of. I
    will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between
    him and my daughter.- My honourable lord, I will most humbly take
    my leave of you.
  Ham. You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will more
    willingly part withal- except my life, except my life, except my
    life,

                    Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  Pol. Fare you well, my lord.
  Ham. These tedious old fools!
  Pol. You go to seek the Lord Hamlet. There he is.
  Ros. [to Polonius] God save you, sir!
                                                Exit [Polonius].  
  Guil. My honour'd lord!
  Ros. My most dear lord!
  Ham. My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern? Ah,
    Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?
  Ros. As the indifferent children of the earth.
  Guil. Happy in that we are not over-happy.
    On Fortune's cap we are not the very button.
  Ham. Nor the soles of her shoe?
  Ros. Neither, my lord.
  Ham. Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her
    favours?
  Guil. Faith, her privates we.
  Ham. In the secret parts of Fortune? O! most true! she is a
    strumpet. What news ?
  Ros. None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.
  Ham. Then is doomsday near! But your news is not true. Let me
    question more in particular. What have you, my good friends,
    deserved at the hands of Fortune that she sends you to prison
    hither?
  Guil. Prison, my lord?  
  Ham. Denmark's a prison.
  Ros. Then is the world one.
  Ham. A goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and
    dungeons, Denmark being one o' th' worst.
  Ros. We think not so, my lord.
  Ham. Why, then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing either good
    or bad but thinking makes it so. To me it is a prison.
  Ros. Why, then your ambition makes it one. 'Tis too narrow for your
    mind.
  Ham. O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a
    king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.
  Guil. Which dreams indeed are ambition; for the very substance of
    the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.
  Ham. A dream itself is but a shadow.
  Ros. Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that
    it is but a shadow's shadow.
  Ham. Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretch'd
    heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we to th' court? for, by my
    fay, I cannot reason.
  Both. We'll wait upon you.  
  Ham. No such matter! I will not sort you with the rest of my
    servants; for, to speak to you like an honest man, I am most
    dreadfully attended. But in the beaten way of friendship, what
    make you at Elsinore?
  Ros. To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.
  Ham. Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you;
    and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny. Were
    you not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free
    visitation? Come, deal justly with me. Come, come! Nay, speak.
  Guil. What should we say, my lord?
  Ham. Why, anything- but to th' purpose. You were sent for; and
    there is a kind of confession in your looks, which your modesties
    have not craft enough to colour. I know the good King and Queen
    have sent for you.
  Ros. To what end, my lord?
  Ham. That you must teach me. But let me conjure you by the rights
    of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the
    obligation of our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear a
    better proposer could charge you withal, be even and direct with
    me, whether you were sent for or no.  
  Ros. [aside to Guildenstern] What say you?
  Ham. [aside] Nay then, I have an eye of you.- If you love me, hold
    not off.
  Guil. My lord, we were sent for.
  Ham. I will tell you why. So shall my anticipation prevent your
    discovery, and your secrecy to the King and Queen moult no
    feather. I have of late- but wherefore I know not- lost all my
    mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed, it goes so
    heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the earth,
    seems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy, the
    air, look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this majestical
    roof fretted with golden fire- why, it appeareth no other thing
    to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What a
    piece of work is a man! how noble in reason! how infinite in
    faculties! in form and moving how express and admirable! in
    action how like an angel! in apprehension how like a god! the
    beauty of the world, the paragon of animals! And yet to me what
    is this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me- no, nor woman
    neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.
  Ros. My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.  
  Ham. Why did you laugh then, when I said 'Man delights not me'?
  Ros. To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what lenten
    entertainment the players shall receive from you. We coted them
    on the way, and hither are they coming to offer you service.
  Ham. He that plays the king shall be welcome- his Majesty shall
    have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil and
    target; the lover shall not sigh gratis; the humorous man shall
    end his part in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose
    lungs are tickle o' th' sere; and the lady shall say her mind
    freely, or the blank verse shall halt fort. What players are
    they?
  Ros. Even those you were wont to take such delight in, the
    tragedians of the city.
  Ham. How chances it they travel? Their residence, both in
    reputation and profit, was better both ways.
  Ros. I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late
    innovation.
  Ham. Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the
    city? Are they so follow'd?
  Ros. No indeed are they not.  
  Ham. How comes it? Do they grow rusty?
  Ros. Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace; but there is,
    sir, an eyrie of children, little eyases, that cry out on the top
    of question and are most tyrannically clapp'd fort. These are now
    the fashion, and so berattle the common stages (so they call
    them) that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goosequills and
    dare scarce come thither.
  Ham. What, are they children? Who maintains 'em? How are they
    escoted? Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can
    sing? Will they not say afterwards, if they should grow
    themselves to common players (as it is most like, if their means
    are no better), their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim
    against their own succession.
  Ros. Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and the nation
    holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy. There was, for a
    while, no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player
    went to cuffs in the question.
  Ham. Is't possible?
  Guil. O, there has been much throwing about of brains.
  Ham. Do the boys carry it away?  
  Ros. Ay, that they do, my lord- Hercules and his load too.
  Ham. It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of Denmark, and
    those that would make mows at him while my father lived give
    twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in
    little. 'Sblood, there is something in this more than natural, if
    philosophy could find it out.

                     Flourish for the Players.

  Guil. There are the players.
  Ham. Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come! Th'
    appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony. Let me comply
    with you in this garb, lest my extent to the players (which I
    tell you must show fairly outwards) should more appear like
    entertainment than yours. You are welcome. But my uncle-father
    and aunt-mother are deceiv'd.
  Guil. In what, my dear lord?
  Ham. I am but mad north-north-west. When the wind is southerly I
    know a hawk from a handsaw.
  
                            Enter Polonius.

  Pol. Well be with you, gentlemen!
  Ham. Hark you, Guildenstern- and you too- at each ear a hearer!
    That great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling
    clouts.
  Ros. Happily he's the second time come to them; for they say an old
    man is twice a child.
  Ham. I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players. Mark it.-
   You say right, sir; a Monday morning; twas so indeed.
  Pol. My lord, I have news to tell you.
  Ham. My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an actor in
    Rome-
  Pol. The actors are come hither, my lord.
  Ham. Buzz, buzz!
  Pol. Upon my honour-
  Ham. Then came each actor on his ass-
  Pol. The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy,
    history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral,
    tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral; scene  
    individable, or poem unlimited. Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor
    Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty, these are
    the only men.
  Ham. O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
  Pol. What treasure had he, my lord?
  Ham. Why,

         'One fair daughter, and no more,
           The which he loved passing well.'

  Pol. [aside] Still on my daughter.
  Ham. Am I not i' th' right, old Jephthah?
  Pol. If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I
    love passing well.
  Ham. Nay, that follows not.
  Pol. What follows then, my lord?
  Ham. Why,

           'As by lot, God wot,'

 and then, you know,
  
           'It came to pass, as most like it was.'

    The first row of the pious chanson will show you more; for look
    where my abridgment comes.

                     Enter four or five Players.

    You are welcome, masters; welcome, all.- I am glad to see thee
    well.- Welcome, good friends.- O, my old friend? Why, thy face is
    valanc'd since I saw thee last. Com'st' thou to' beard me in
    Denmark?- What, my young lady and mistress? By'r Lady, your
    ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last by the
    altitude of a chopine. Pray God your voice, like a piece of
    uncurrent gold, be not crack'd within the ring.- Masters, you are
    all welcome. We'll e'en to't like French falconers, fly at
    anything we see. We'll have a speech straight. Come, give us a
    taste of your quality. Come, a passionate speech.
  1. Play. What speech, my good lord?
  Ham. I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never acted;
    or if it was, not above once; for the play, I remember, pleas'd  
    not the million, 'twas caviary to the general; but it was (as I
    receiv'd it, and others, whose judgments in such matters cried in
    the top of mine) an excellent play, well digested in the scenes,
    set down with as much modesty as cunning. I remember one said
    there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury,
    nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of
    affectation; but call'd it an honest method, as wholesome as
    sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One speech in't
    I chiefly lov'd. 'Twas AEneas' tale to Dido, and thereabout of it
    especially where he speaks of Priam's slaughter. If it live in
    your memory, begin at this line- let me see, let me see:

         'The rugged Pyrrhus, like th' Hyrcanian beast-'

    'Tis not so; it begins with Pyrrhus:

         'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,
         Black as his purpose, did the night resemble
         When he lay couched in the ominous horse,
         Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd  
         With heraldry more dismal. Head to foot
         Now is be total gules, horridly trick'd
         With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
         Bak'd and impasted with the parching streets,
         That lend a tyrannous and a damned light
         To their lord's murther. Roasted in wrath and fire,
         And thus o'ersized with coagulate gore,
         With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
         Old grandsire Priam seeks.'

    So, proceed you.
  Pol. Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good
     discretion.

  1. Play. 'Anon he finds him,
      Striking too short at Greeks. His antique sword,
      Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
      Repugnant to command. Unequal match'd,
      Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide;
      But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword  
      Th' unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
      Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top
      Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash
      Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear. For lo! his sword,
      Which was declining on the milky head
      Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' th' air to stick.
      So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,
      And, like a neutral to his will and matter,
      Did nothing.
      But, as we often see, against some storm,
      A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
      The bold winds speechless, and the orb below
      As hush as death- anon the dreadful thunder
      Doth rend the region; so, after Pyrrhus' pause,
      Aroused vengeance sets him new awork;
      And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall
      On Mars's armour, forg'd for proof eterne,
      With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword
      Now falls on Priam.
      Out, out, thou strumpet Fortune! All you gods,  
      In general synod take away her power;
      Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,
      And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,
      As low as to the fiends!

  Pol. This is too long.
  Ham. It shall to the barber's, with your beard.- Prithee say on.
    He's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps. Say on; come to
    Hecuba.

  1. Play. 'But who, O who, had seen the mobled queen-'

  Ham. 'The mobled queen'?
  Pol. That's good! 'Mobled queen' is good.

  1. Play. 'Run barefoot up and down, threat'ning the flames
      With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head
      Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,
      About her lank and all o'erteemed loins,
      A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up-  
      Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd
      'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have pronounc'd.
      But if the gods themselves did see her then,
      When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
      In Mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,
      The instant burst of clamour that she made
      (Unless things mortal move them not at all)
